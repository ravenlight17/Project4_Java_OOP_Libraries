Overall Problem:
I want to build a small knowledge-base of music that displays some details about the artist along with a link to their music on Youtube.   
So while listening to the song in one of your favorite playlists, you can see some details about the musician that created that song.
Once a small set of music data was built to keep it simple we want to see what songs are in the small in-memory database for a given playlist. The goal is to display the song, the artist, some details about that artist (where they are from, their major influence and a Youtube link to that song).

Learning Goals: 
Learn how to use subclasses, understand the difference between “Has-A” and “Is-A” relationships, know the basics of class design, understand the difference between an Array and an ArrayList
