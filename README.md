Overall Problem:
You want to build a small knowledge-base of your music that displays some details about the artist along with a link to their music on Youtube.   
So while you’re listening to the song in one of your favorite playlists, you can see some details about the musician that created that song.
Once we have built a small set of music data (just a few songs to keep it simple) we want to see what songs are in your small in-memory database for a given playlist.  You want to display the song, the artist, some details about that artist (where they are from, their major influence and a Youtube link to that song.
